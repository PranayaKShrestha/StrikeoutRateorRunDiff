# Strikeout Differential vs Run Differential: Which Predicts Team Win Percentage Best ⚾

Recently, I was listening to the Blair & Barker podcast (Blue Jays podcast), and they had a guest from the Colorado Rockies analyst team. He said something interesting that sparked this quick project. He said 'Strikeout Differential signals a better team than run differential... The [Blue Jays] pitching staff has struck out more than their offense has, and it's by 300.' That is the first time I've ever heard use strikeout differential as a strong predictor for team wins.
